Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Principal at [Inner Product LLC](https://inner-product.com), a functional programming consultancy, where I focus on building systems, teaching, and mentoring.

Lately I've been writing a book, [Essential Effects](https://essentialeffects.dev), about how to safely create, compose, and execute effectful Scala programs using the Typelevel [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect) library.
